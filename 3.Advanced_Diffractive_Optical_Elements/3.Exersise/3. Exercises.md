## Exersice 3.1

Design a 16-level 1D phase grating using MATLAB and estimate the
efficiency in the 1 st diffraction order.

## Exersice 3.2

Design a negative 4-level FZP and simulate its far-field diffraction
pattern.

## Exersice 3.3

Design a binary spiral phase plate with L = 5 and simulate its diffraction
pattern.

## Exersice 3.4

Design a 3-level DOE from an object of your choice and simulate its
diffraction pattern.

## Exersice 3.5

Design a gradient ring lens with a focal length f = 2 mm and a ring
diameter r0 = 0.1 mm.
