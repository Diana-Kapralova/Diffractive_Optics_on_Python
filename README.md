# Diffractive_Optics_on_Python
Make python implementation of diffractive elements on Python. Implementing all code according to MatLab code from here:

_Book_: **Shanti Bhattacharya and Anand Vijayakumar. Design and fabrication of diffractive optical elements with MATLAB, 2017**

_In addition, making some exercises from book_

## Assumption
1. The amplitude and phase values are assigned assuming the size of each pixel to be 1 &mu;m.
## Abbreviation:
