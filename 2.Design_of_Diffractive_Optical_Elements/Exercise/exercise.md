## Exersice 1

Design a 1D phase grating to generate diffraction spots such that the
relative intensity of 1 st diffraction order is only 50% that of the 0 th diffraction
order. Verify the result by estimating the efficiency values

## Exersice 2 

Design a 2D grating to generate 3 x 3 diffraction spots of equal
intensity. Verify the result by estimating the efficiency values.

## Exercise 3

Design a triangular grating array with a period of 100 &mu;m along both
the x and y directions and calculate its far-field diffraction pattern

## Exercise 4

Design a 2D phase FZP with a focal length of 3000 &mu;m along the
x direction and 6000 &mu;m along the y direction.
