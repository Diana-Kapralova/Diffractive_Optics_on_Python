## Exersice 1

Design a 1D phase grating to generate diffraction spots such that the
relative intensity of 1 st diffraction order is only 50% that of the 0 th diffraction
order. Verify the result by estimating the efficiency values

## Exersice 2 

Design a 2D grating to generate 3 x 3 diffraction spots of equal
intensity. Verify the result with MATLAB.
